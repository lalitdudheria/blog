Hi everyone, I always wanted to have a place to jote down my thoughts. Sometimes I feel what can I say that haven't been said before but it took me a lot of time to realize that is not the point. You never know how your actions or your words might create an impact. There is a beautiful line in the movie Gladiator

> What men do in life, echoes in eternity.

After alot of dilly dallying in my head, I finally decided to create a website and start writing. What am I going to write about ? I don't know, will go with the flow probably and why a website ? when I could directly use any platform like Medium or Substack. The problem I feel with platforms like Medium is they control the distribution and the content. They can create a paywall for any of my articles whenever they want and I dont want. I want complete autonomy over my content and hence the decision to create this.
